This code and data folder contain two sub-folders:
1) SRM estimation in synthetic setup.
2) Vehicular routing application using SUMO
Here, each sub-folder contains files related to that are used in respective experiments icluding plots and maps. Below are details of each sub-folder.

1) SRM estimation in synthetic setup: it include two files,
a) sampleVSerror.py : to generate figure 1. in the paper.
b) table.py : to generate Table 1. of paper.

2) Vehicular routing application using SUMO : To run this simulation you need to first install SUMO http://sumo.dlr.de/wiki/Downloads. To start simulation run osm_runner_SRM.py, and to get probabilty of best route in successive reject algorithm used in paper run osm_runner_prob.py
