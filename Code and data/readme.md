Below are details of each sub-folder.

1) SRM estimation in synthetic setup: 

> It include two files,
>> a) sampleVSerror.py : to generate figure 3.1 in the thesis.
>> b) table.py : to generate Table 3.1 of the thesis.

2) Vehicular routing application using SUMO : 

>To run this simulation you need to first install SUMO http://sumo.dlr.de/wiki/Downloads. To start simulation run osm_runner_SRM.py, and to get probabilty of best route in successive reject algorithm used in paper run osm_runner_prob.py
